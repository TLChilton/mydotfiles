All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. 
  It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. 
  Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. 

Because how could the end be happy? 
  How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? 
But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. 
  A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. 
Those were the stories that stayed with you. 
  That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. 
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
  Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. 
  They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.

“It is not the critic who counts; 
  not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
  whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; 
  who errs and comes short again and again; 
  because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; 
  but who does actually strive to do the deed; 
  who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, 
  who spends himself in a worthy cause, 
  who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement 
  and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. 

So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls 
  who know neither victory nor defeat.”

I think one of the things that really separates 
  us from the high primates is that we’re tool builders. 

I read a study that measured the efficiency of locomotion 
for various species on the planet. 
The condor used the least energy to move a kilometer. 
  And, humans came in with a rather unimpressive showing, 
  about a third of the way down the list. 
  It was not too proud a showing for the crown of creation. 
  So, that didn’t look so good. 

But, then somebody at Scientific American had the insight 
  to test the efficiency of locomotion for a man on a bicycle. 
  And, a man on a bicycle, a human on a bicycle, blew the condor away, 
  completely off the top of the charts.

And that’s what a computer is to me. 

What a computer is to me 
  is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, 
  and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.”

"For a number of years I have been familiar with the observation 
 that the quality of programmers is a decreasing function of the 
 density of go to statements in the programs they produce. 
 More recently I discovered why the use of the go to statement has 
 such disastrous effects, and I became convinced that the go to statement 
 should be abolished from all "higher level" programming languages."

The major cause [of the software crisis] 
is that the machines have become several 
orders of magnitude more powerful! To put 
it quite bluntly: as long as there were no 
machines, programming was no problem at 
all; when we had a few weak computers, 
programming became a mild problem, and now 
we have gigantic computers, programming has 
become an equally gigantic problem. In this 
sense the electronic industry has not solved 
a single problem, it has only created them, 
it has created the problem of using its products.

A confusion of even longer standing came from the fact 
that the unprepared included the electronic engineers 
that were supposed to design, build and maintain the 
machines. The job was actually beyond the electronic 
technology of the day, and, as a result, the question 
of how to get and keep the physical equipment more or 
less in working condition became in the early days the 
all-overriding concern. As a result, the topic became – 
primarily in the USA – prematurely known as 
'computer science' – which, actually, is like referring 
to surgery as 'knife science' – and it was firmly implanted 
in people's minds that computing science is about machines 
and their peripheral equipment. Quod non [Latin: "Which is not true"]. 
We now know that electronic technology has no more to 
contribute to computing than the physical equipment. We 
now know that programmable computer is no more and no less 
than an extremely handy device for realizing any conceivable 
mechanism without changing a single wire, and that the core 
challenge for computing science is hence a conceptual one, 
viz., what (abstract) mechanisms we can conceive without 
getting lost in the complexities of our own making.
