Why do we fall Master Bruce?

All that is gold does not glitter,
Not all those who wander are lost;
The old that is strong does not wither,
Deep roots are not reached by the frost.
From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
A light from the shadows shall spring;
Renewed shall be blade that was broken,
The crownless again shall be king.

I know. It's all wrong. By rights we shouldn't even be here. But we are. 
  It's like in the great stories, Mr. Frodo. The ones that really mattered. 
  Full of darkness and danger, they were. And sometimes you didn't want to know the end. 

Because how could the end be happy? 
  How could the world go back to the way it was when so much bad had happened? 
But in the end, it's only a passing thing, this shadow. Even darkness must pass. 
  A new day will come. And when the sun shines it will shine out the clearer. 
Those were the stories that stayed with you. 
  That meant something, even if you were too small to understand why. 
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand. I know now. 
  Folk in those stories had lots of chances of turning back, only they didn't. 
  They kept going. Because they were holding on to something.

“It is not the critic who counts; 
  not the man who points out how the strong man stumbles, 
  or where the doer of deeds could have done them better. 

The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena,
  whose face is marred by dust and sweat and blood, who strives valiantly; 
  who errs and comes short again and again; 
  because there is not effort without error and shortcomings; 
  but who does actually strive to do the deed; 
  who knows the great enthusiasm, the great devotion, 
  who spends himself in a worthy cause, 
  who at the best knows in the end the triumph of high achievement 
  and who at the worst, if he fails, at least he fails while daring greatly. 

So that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls 
  who know neither victory nor defeat.”

If you love a flower, don’t pick it up. 
  Because if you pick it up it dies and it ceases to be what you love. 
So if you love a flower, let it be. 
  Love is not about possession. Love is about appreciation.

"I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. 
I've lost almost 300 games.
26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed.
I've failed over and over and over again in my life. 
And that is why I succeed"
